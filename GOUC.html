                <h2>Create a list</h2>
            <p>Cold showers, waking up early, going for a run, taking the bike instead of the subway, calling your mother on the phone—what things make you uncomfortable? Listing out the things out of your comfort zone is a great way to visualize something you can do.
                    <br><span>Tip</span>: Create your own list! Write down 10-20 things you can do every day that makes you feel uncomfortable. Pick a few to do each day.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="list">
                <h2>Start small</h2>
            <p>Switch up your routine just a little! For instance, if you regularly eat alone at your cubicle instead of with your colleagues, try moving to a public table and eating alone. If you`re comfortable enough, you might even want to try and invite your colleagues over for a lunch chat or scope out a new restaurant venue.

                <br><span>Tip</span>: Find that one tiny thing you can do to make a more significant difference and break out of your comfort zone!.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="list">
                <h2>Try a new skill</h2>
            <p>Try something new, maybe go to for a hike, learn to solve the rubik's cube, go to the cinema alone, read a book, shower with your clothes on. Just do whatever you want it doesn't have to be immediately rewarding. Learning a new skill puts you to the learning phase, meaning you already passed the fear zone.
                <br><span>Tip</span>: Do something new without planing it and overthinking it, embrace the feeling of living.

            <div class="list">
                <h2>Reframe your stress</h2>
            <p>Experiencing your anxiety and stress about stepping out of your comfort zone can be a real drag, so why not change it? The question is: what will you do with it?
                <br><span>Tip</span>: Try this. The next time you feel negative about doing something new, take away the label of “good” or “bad.” Just take hold of the feeling and use it as fuel to easily engage in your latest and greatest activity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="list">
                <h2>Rejection Therapy</h2>
            <p>Many of us are afraid, which is why we don't try anything new because of the villain that we call “rejection.” But failure can be a golden opportunity. By failing you adapt yourself to get not be scared of getting out of the comfort zone which means you have beat the fear zone.
                <br><span>Tip</span>: Try getting purposefully rejected, ask a girl out, ask someone for money, reach out to an investor for your business plan, etc.

            <div class="list">
                <h2>Find your community</h2>
            <p>Whether you want to travel, eat better, workout, quit something or start something, being with people who can go through the journey with you is a big motivator to keep on pushing for everyone.
                This is an ongoing process, so surround yourself with people who support you and motivate you to keep going through with new challenges.
                <br><span>Tip</span>: Go to places that you know you can meet people who are on the same journey as you.

            <div class="list">
                <h2>Let go</h2>
            <p>You may not hear this but giving up a bit of control can be a great way to break from your comfort zone. In this state of not controlling everything, you create opportunities for the element of surprise to occur and for you to adapt to. After accomplishing the difficult feat, you'll feel more capable of handling more random situations and expanding your comfort zone in the future!
                <br><span>Tip</span>: Pick a random country to make your next vacation destination, ask a friend for a random restaurant to go to, start a road trip without any plans or gps, etc.
