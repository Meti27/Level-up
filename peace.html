                    <p>Peace of mind, also described as inner calm, refers to an internal state of tranquility. When you have mental peace you might feel:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>at ease with yourself</li>
                        <li>a sense of self-compassion</li>
                        <li>unruffled by day-to-day worries</li>
                        <li>prepared to welcome whatever life tosses your way</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You might assume you can only find peace from within when you're finally completely free of troubles, but that's not the case. <br>In fact, it often works the other way around.
                        Feeling at peace internally can boost overall contentment and feelings of happiness, regardless of the challenges you face. <br>A relaxed and calm outlook can help you navigate life's often-turbulent waters more smoothly.</p>
