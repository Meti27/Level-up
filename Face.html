                    <p>The difference between bumpy & acne skin and glowing smooth skin is the biggest difference in your facial attractiveness. <br>The three most important things that can help you get clear glowing skin are: diet, skincare, hygiene. <br>For now lets help you put together a simple and effective skincare routine.</p>
                    <h2>Step zero</h2>
                    <p>Before buying any products you must first know which products are best suitable for your skin. A simple thing you can do is wash your face with cold water, dry it with a clean paper towel and wait for 30 mins to see what your skintype is.</p></div>

                    </div>
                    <div class="skincare-text">
                        <h2>First step</h2>
                        <p>First skincare product you need is a cleanser. Depending on your skintype here are a few cleansers you can choose from</p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Cerave's foaming facial cleanser</dt>
                            <dd>For oily skin</dd>
                            <dt>Cerave's hydrating cream-to-foam cleanser</dt>
                            <dd>For combination skin</dd>
                            <dt>Cerave's hydrating facial cleanser</dt>
                            <dd>For dry skin</dd>
                            <dt>Cetaphil's Oily skin Cleanser</dt>
                            <dd>For combination to oily skin</dd>
                            <dt>Cetaphil's Gentle cleanser</dt>
                            <dd>For dry skin</dd>
                        </dl>
                        <h2>Second Step</h2>
                        <p>For the most simple skincare routine all you need is a moisturizer & sunscreen (for the morning only). Here are some of the best:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cerave's daily moisturizing lotion</li>
                            <li>Ceraves's facial moisturizing lotion AM-contains suncreen</li>
                            <li>Cerave's Facial moisturizing lotion PM</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Extra tips</h2>
                        <p>If you don't want to invest more money on skincare you should chose just one cleanser one pm moisterizer and one am moisterizer and you are good. But if you want better results you need to get these products as well:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Invest in a silk pillowcase - it's much more sensitive on the skin and hair</li>
                            <li>Retinol - removes acne,wrinkles,blackheads,etc</li>
                            <li>An under eye cream</li>
                            <li>Vaseline - put to lips and dark circles before bed (if u don't use under eye cream)</li>
                            <li>To exfoliate your lips use your toothbrush and apply vaseline after (do this twice a week)</li>
                            <li>La roche-posay's Effeclar duo - use it as a moisterizer if you have acne</li>
                            <li>Exfoliating face mask - use these once a week for more glow </li>
                            <li>Volufline - promotes skin volume similar to lipofilling (use it in your lips & dark circles and smile lines)</li>

                        </ul>

                    <h1>How to get a more defined face</h1>
                    <h2>Loose bodyfat</h2>
                    <p>If you are above 15% bodyfat its only natural you can't see your bone structure. First step to getting a more defined face is loosing bodyfat. <br>
                    Firstly go workout whether at the gym or at home, you can lose body fat only if you go on a cut. </p>
                    <h2>Practice Mewing</h2>
                    <p>Mewing is the practice of proper tounge posture, essentialy you put your tounge on the roof of your mouth. This practice was created by orthodontist John Mew. <br>It is said that it helps reduce a double chin and helps sharpening your jawline.
                    There are evidence that this practice does work but to see results you need to properly learn how to do it because if you do it wrong it can have the opposite effects and also negativly affect your teeth. <br>
                    Here are some more detailed videos on mewing: <a href="https://youtu.be/BEHeigyRPbI">How to mew in 5 steps</a> <br><a href="https://youtu.be/dv0pUuDBkho">MEWING MISTAKES | Why You're Not Seeing Jawline Improvements</a></p>
                    <h2>Take care of inflammation</h2>
                    <p>Inflammation can make your face look puffy and way less defined than what it is. You can try after waking up doing a cold shower or if you dont have time for that put a spoon in the freezer and use it on your dark circles. <br>
                    Lower your salt and sugar intake. When we eat sugar our body releases the hormone insulin to deal with it. The problem is that insulin also triggers infammation which leads to puffy face and even acne breakouts. The sodium in salt pulls water into your blood vessels and enlarges them, this can cause your face to swell. Im not saying you should cut out sugar and salt entirely but bit by bit try to lower your daily intake. </p>

                    <h1>Haircare</h1>
                    <p>Most men don't even know what hair care is they just use their standard 3 in 1 shampoo but the top models know that taking care of your hair is essential overall to look better</p>
                    <h2>What products to use</h2>
                    <p>Hair care is simple all you need is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shampoo - use everyother day or 3 times a week</li>
                        <li>Conditioner - use everyday</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now if your skin is damaged which it probably is if you have been shampooing it everyday you should try out argan oil or rosmarine oil. <br>
                    As a bonus you can try saltspray for a more voluminous look.</p>
