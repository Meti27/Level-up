            <div class="text"><p>You want to be the type of guy that everyone talks about how good you smell. People should know you've entered a room before they even turn around. This is the power of having a signature scent. <br>
                Fragrance is a personal statement, as it's all about how the scent smells on you specifically and how it's perceived by others. Finding your signature scent can make you turn heads and make a lasting impression that says “I have arrived”. <br>
                In this article, we're going to go through fragrance tips, how to build a fragrance collection, fragrance suggestions for different price points and how to find your signature scent.</p></div>

                    <h2>Must know</h2>
                    <p>1. Most important thing before using a fragrance is to be clean and not smell bad, if you try to mask the bad smell with a fragrance your body odor will mix with the fragrance and leave you with a bad smell of the fragrance.</p>
                    <p>2. Less is more- if you are using a quality fragrance most depending on the sillage u need from 3 to 7 sprays max. </p>
                <p>3. Use the right fragrance for the right moment- if it's a hot day of summer don't go spraying 7 sprays of "stronger with you" the smell will be overpowering and just won't feel right, knowing what fragrance to use on different occasions is key.</p>
            <p>4. More expensive is not always better- you can find plenty of clones of niche fragrances with the 1/3 of the price, don't go blind buying everything unless you are rich then just do what you want.  </p>

                    <p>Extra fragrance tips</p>
                    <p>A very important thing we haven't mentioned yet is that fragrances also have seasons that they are most suitable for, instead of making a whole list of each season and what fragrances shine in that season i will let you do your own research. <br>
                    Go to <a href="https://www.fragrantica.com/">Fragrantica</a> and look at which season the fragrance is most suitable for here you also have longevity&sillage and reviews from people. </p>
                    <h2>Where to spray</h2>
                    <p>Depending on how strong the fragrance is you should spray 3 to 7 times now the main spraying points are going to be: behind each ear, on the neck , wrist or elbow, collar each side. Follow this guide and please do not overspray a fragrance is meant to be noticed but not suffocate people.
                        <br>An extra tip to make your fragrance last much longer and perform better is to put vaseline on the spray points before spraying.
