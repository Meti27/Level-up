                    <h2>Oral hygiene</h2>
                    <p>Oral hygiene plays a vital role in maintaining overall health and well-being. It refers to the practice of keeping the mouth clean and free from any oral diseases or conditions. Maintaining good oral hygiene is not only about having a beautiful smile but also no bad breath and bacteria. </p>
                    <p>How to maintain good oral hygiene?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brush teeth twice a day for at least 3 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Floss daily at least at night- only brushing doesn't remove the food you have stuck between your teeth so flossing is essenital to not let bacteria form and have bad breath.</li>
                        <li>Use a tounge scraper- Even after you do the steps above you still have a lot of bacteria stuck in your tounge without a tounge scraper the bacteria builds up resulting in bad breath.</li>
                        <li>Mouthwash- TeraBreath is the best mouthwash out there.</li>
                        <li>Whitening strips</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Body Hygiene</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Body hygiene, also known as personal hygiene, is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being. It involves taking care of your body through practices that promote cleanliness and prevent the spread of germs and diseases. Proper body hygiene not only keeps you physically healthy but also contributes to your mental and emotional well-being. </p>
                    <p>How to maintain good body hygiene</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shower daily</li>
                        <li>Use a good bodywash- Method Men,Molton Brown,Harry's,etc.</li>
                        <li>Use a loofah sponge- don't just use your hand, a loofah allows to much better get rid of bacteria.</li>
                        <li>Use unfragranced bodylotion after showering- after you shower you deplete the body of its natural oils so you need to use lotion to keep it healthy and to make it glow.</li>
                        <li>Shave your armpits&private places- hair lets bacteria build up faster making you smell bad.</li>
                        <li>Use deoderant daily- Dove&OldSpice are solid aluminium choices but if u want natural deoderant try Native but keep in mind natural deoderants arent as effective.</li>
                        <li>If you sweat excessively try strong antiperspirants like- Eucerin, Absolute Torr, Certain Dri or you can also try Underarm deoderant wipes.</li>
                        <li>Invest in a nail kit</li>
                        <li>Change your bed sheets every week -while sleeping you sweat and all the bacteria builds up making your skin breakout, so make sure to change your bed sheets weekly.</li>
                    </ul>
