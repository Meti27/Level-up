                <h1>When to not take cold showers</h1>
                <p><span class="span">After hyporthrophy training</span>. Taking a cold shower or cold exposure after training for muscle growth limits the amount of muscle you could gain because it cold showers stop inflammation which is a main component when muscle builds.</p>
                <p><span class="span">When you are sick</span>. If you have cold symptoms don't take cold showers. Cold exposure helps the cold get worse beacuse cold exposure may reduce the immune response and make it harder for the body to fight off germs.</p>
                <p><span class="span">Before going to bed</span>. As we mentioned above cold exposure raises your alertness which probably will affect your sleepiness negatively.</p>

            <div class="avoid-coldshower">
                <h1>How to incorporate cold showers into your daily-life</h1>
                <p><span class="span">Start of slow</span>. If you never tried cold exposure before start slow and build up your willpower slowly. At first start the shower water temperature same as always slowly turning it colder near the end you should arrive at the coldest temperature your shower has and try to withstand it 30 sec. Keep adding 5 seconds every day or however you want to progress until you can take a full cold shower.</p>
                <p><span class="span">Take one every morning</span>. Taking a cold shower in the morning will help you wake up better, raise alertness and it will give you a good hit of dopamine making u more energetic and ready for the day. Beacuse you already put your body through stress you will be more prepared of whatever problems arise during your day.</p>
                <p><span class="span">Recovery days</span>. If you are an athlete or a bodybuilder doing cold exposure on your rest day can really help relieve muscle soreness, ultimately making you recover faster and have more time to train. You can try filling your bath with cold water and ice and try to stay there as long as you can from 5 to 20 min. If you also want to boost the dopamine hit drink coffe, as caffein helps the dopamine receptors be twice as susceptible to the dopamine that you have in your system. </p>
