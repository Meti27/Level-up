                    <p>There is an scientifically proven method that i know seems to good to be true but it works.It might be a little hard to do but i promise you that after this detox you will feel so much better mentally.</p>
                    <p>Dopamine is a hormone that often is connected with motivation&pleasure. The reason why you dont have any motivation to do anything is because you have fried your dopamine receptors with short term pleasures such as:scrolling through your phone watching short videos,eating junk food,watching porn, etc. </p>
                    <p>Now to fix this we are going for a week eliminate the bad habits and implement some good ones.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not use your phone - for this week do not consume any social media content, don't watch any movies or shows and do not play videogames</li>
                        <li>Eat clean - stop eating junk food cut our all processed food and sugar, drink only water</li>
                        <li>Do not masturbate or watch any adult films</li>
                        <li>Read at least 30 minutes daily - preferably read an non-fiction book so you can learn while reading</li>
                        <li>Meditate at least 10 minutes daily -meditation is not a religious act its simply clearing your mind and make u able to focus better, it is also the biggest contributor to removing anxiety</li>
                        <li>Go out - go for a walk or hike in nature connect with nature, if you aren't that type of person go socialize with friends</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After the end of the week you can go back to using your phone but now do it at a more controlled rate and dont forget never get too comfortable because you will start the deppresive loop again and the detox after a month will be worthless.Keep doing the good habits and completly remove porn and short videos.</p>
                    <p>The benefits you will feel after this detox: way better sleep quality,more energy levels,more focus,less anxiety,more motivation,etc.</p>

                <div class="detox-text">
                    <p>Remember to always keep a clean space whether that be at work or at home.A clean space represent a clear mind, having a clean space will greatly improve your mental clarity and you will be able to focus more at the task that u should be doing, it helps you work more effectively. </p>
                    <p>For me my bedroom is also my work space so its a two in one but whatever places you stay longer to make sure to always keep it clean and tidy. Invest in your bedroom&working space buy a few air cleaning plants like: Snake plant, Peace lily, English ivy,Lavender,etc. Maybe put up posters that you can look at and remember why you started to keep you motivated.</p>
